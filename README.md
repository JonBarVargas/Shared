## General
Shared aims to provide authentic stories from homosexual men in a form of interactive media. Whether be stories from personal experiences or simply a narrative discussions Shared brings learned lessons for others to learn from.

## Background
When homosexual men come to terms with their sexuality they are provided with little to no guidance on how to navigate life as a gay man. This thrusts individuals to relearn social and dating conventions. Confusions arise to how a healthy homosexual relationship is formed and what is looked like. What is readily available is the toxic hypersexual fantasy that is sold to homosexual men. All of these confusions are partly due to lack of representation: in media, in society, and in a form of a mentor/role model.

<br>
This application provides a knowledge center about the unique problems that homosexual men face. By providing stories from real people it creates sparks of reflection and discussion. Other homosexual men can take tidbits of wisdom from others and apply lessons learned to their own life.
